          Since we were building the platform up from ground zero, thorough research was critical in helping us understand the competitive landscape, the users we were designing for, and the problems that we needed to solve.
          Our extensive research laid the foundation for the framework of our design and the product roadmap.

          <br><br>

          <h3>Painting a picture of the equity crowdfunding landscape</h3>
          The first order of business was to perform a market and feature analysis of the top 6 competitors in the market in order to understand how Crowdfund Mainstreet would fit into this space, and more importantly, differentiate itself.
          Through our research we discovered that Crowdfund Mainstreet had the opportunity to promote local, mission-driven businesses using proper educational resources and by making small-scale investing easier and less intimidating.

          <h3>Getting to know issuers and investors</h3>
          We conducted 16 qualitative user interviews with issuers and investors to figure out the biggest pain points in raising money and the biggest barriers to investing.
          With this two-sided marketplace, it was important to find value alignment between issuers and investors. We came up with four personas - two investors and two issuers.
          Through our research, we discovered that users <b>care most about accessibility and community</b>.

          <div class="cs-image"><img src="images/cfms_personas.png" style="max-width: 600px;" data-aos="fade-up" /><br></div>

          <h5>Issuers cared about:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>A strong community & network</li>
            <li>Finding the right investors who care about social impact</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Investors cared about:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Transparency/trust in investing</li>
            <li>Friendly and unintimidating process</li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <h3>Making the platform accessible and community-oriented</h3>
          In order to address our users main concerns, we focused on implementing:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Unregistered browsing access</b> to explore campaigns</li>
            <li><b>A low-friction registration</b> and onboarding process</li>
            <li><b>Community building</b> features such as a message board, FAQs, live updates</li>
            <li><b>Educational resources</b> like learning materials and help section</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <br>

          <div class="cs-text">
          <h3>Creating a low-friction onboarding and sign up flow</h3>

          As part of the onboarding team, our main goal was to create a low-friction sign up flow.
          We considered several versions of flows, trying to balance quick & easy completion with gathering enough upfront information during the sign up process to best match investors and issuers.

          <img src="images/cfms_onboarding.png"/ data-aos="fade-up">

          <h5>Key Considerations</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>Steps to completion</li>
            <li>Information cost (number of fields)</li>
            <li>Effort investment (number of decisions and activities)</li>
            <li>Users can sign up as investors and/or issuers</li>
            <li>Gathering enough information from users (to help with matching)</li>
          </ul>
          <br>

          <h3>Final prototype and validation testing</h3>
          Our validation testing showed a high level of trust and likelihood to invest. Both issuers and investors cited location of mission, internal messaging function, comment and updates features to be key factors in building trust and transparency.
